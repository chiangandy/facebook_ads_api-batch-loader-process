Facebook_ads_api-batch-loader-process
=====================================
The goal of this project is to rewrite a Facebook ads api process and append batch loader function

We found the facebook ads api is not easy to use, so this project is going to make it more easy to upload AD data into the facebook.
we hope eveyone can do more easier when manage facebook ad data is required. 
please contact with me if you has opinion for this. 

Basically these program is absolute free for use, you can even modify and customize to be your process as you want, but don't hate to send
comments for me. 

Please try in mind, it is no any warranty for this program. if you have issue for warranty, please ignore this.

Developer Andy Chiang
